                2. Wear a mask while commuting to minimise the risk of catching infection from others - this is particularly applicable if you commute via public transport including cabs and autos.<br>

                4. Avoid visiting crowded places (markets, restaurants etc.) unless absolutely necessary.<br>
                5. Avoid touching your eyes, noses, mouth; especially with unwashed hands. <br>
                6. If you develop a cold, cough or flu like symptoms - please get yourself tested at the earliest and take work from home/leaves till you fully recover.<br>
